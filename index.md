Make yourself at home

## Bio

My name is Shiva and I was born in India. I don't remember much of my life until I moved to the US in 2012. When I first came to the US, I lived at Connecticut where I started playing clarinet in the school band. Eventually, I moved to Westborough, MA and started playing in the school band in 5th grade. I worked my way through school until 8th grade when I realized I wanted to do something with music as a career. I auditioned for districts in 8th and 9th grade and didn't make it. I then made it my sophmore year. Then I made it into states my senior year. I eventually auditioned into UMass Amherst for Music Performance and Music Education.

In my freshman year of high school, I started teaching math to elementary school children and donated the funds to a nonprofit organization called "People for India" that develops leadership skills, infrastructure, and core values in India. Over the years, I contintued my passion for music and found a new passion for teaching. In my junior year, I had a teacher that changed my opinion about math. He really made me work hard and I was able to test into AP Calculus. That teacher will be one of the most influential teachers, along with my band teachers, for me. Even as a college student, I am still teaching for "People for India" and I've raised over $10k in the past 4 years I've been teaching.
